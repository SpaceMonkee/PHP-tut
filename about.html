        <p id="textfield">I consider myself very lucky to have worked for someone as skilled and humble as Hethe is. Hands down he’s one of the most inspiring concept artists i’ve worked with. He’s unique and goes against the grain of industry trends and has his own artistic voice. His ability to tackle any kind of task is simultaneously mind boggling and inspiring. It was an amazing experience watching Hethe work.</p>
        <p id="textfield">His character design skills are some of the best you’ll see in the industry. Same can be said about his environment concepts. The biggest thing I picked up from working with Hethe was the importance of narrative. Whether it be the cut of someone’s hair or the way their clothing is worn.</p>
        <p id="textfield">Everything has a purpose and Hethe is a master of details and artistic storytelling. Needless to say it was educational working with him. On top of all that he’s a guy you’ll want as a friend and mentor.</p>
        <p id="textfield">I was extremely fortunate to have had the chance to work under Hethe at Trion worlds. Hethe was leading the concept team at the time and was as confident and considerate as a manager as he is an artist.</p>
        <p id="textfield">Hethe is one of THE most talented concept artists i have ever worked with and has a natural flair to his work that is often missing in commercial conceptual art and is also super efficient, a true role model of an artist for the team.</p>
        <p id="textfield">One glance at his portfolio or anything that he is working on is enough proof of his mastery of sketching, painting and capturing likeness and character. I learnt so much from just working with and around hethe and wish i had the opportunity to continue to do so. Apart from all this, Hethe is also a genuinely good and kind guy, an absolute joy to be around. Im proud to call Hethe a friend and even happier i had the chance to work with the guy.</p>
